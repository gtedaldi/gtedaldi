The first tech I can recall owning.... yikes.
I remember a neon orange squeeze mini flashlight from South of the Border in beautiful Hamer, South Carolina.
I probably played Atari 2600 before NES.

I'm from Massapequa.  That's a whole thing.

I studied Art, Computer Technologies, Graphic Arts, CS, and American Sign Languge.
I'm over it.

I've been doing this all for way too long.  Lately with all the nonsense of the world I've been slightly interested in the concept of Theology in Technology.
Of all I've seen technolody do-  visuals seem to be what people get the most excited about.
